Hi! I'm Hariom Lovewanshi, a recent graduate in Computer Science and Engineering from the Mittal Institute of Technology, Bhopal (batch of 2024). I have a strong foundation in Java programming, and problem-solving, which has shaped my passion for creating efficient and scalable solutions in software development.

I've worked on several projects, including a hotel booking website Application built with spring boot and java, and a Real Estate Web Application built with JavaScript and React, enhancing my front-end development skills and hands-on experience in building user-friendly interfaces. My technical expertise extends to Java core concepts, object-oriented programming principles, and MySQL databases.

I am a strong communicator, team player, and fast learner with a problem-solving mindset, eager to tackle challenges and contribute meaningfully. I am actively seeking internship opportunities in software engineering, web development, or data science to apply my skills, gain practical experience, and collaborate on impactful projects.

Letâ€™s connect and explore opportunities to create innovative solutions together!
